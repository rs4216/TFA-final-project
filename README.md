## Description of project

In "top10.ipynb", in order to count the top 10 complaint type , we first use "groupby" to group the dataset by the 'complain type' columns, then sorted the value by descending orders. After that we use "head" function to show the top 10 value and save it to the top10 variable.

In "Parking.ipynb", we analyzed whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in our ZIP code than they are in general, by calculating and comparing their respective proportions.
